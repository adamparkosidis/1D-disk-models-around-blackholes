Here we reproduce the sharp dust cut-off result of Birnstiel & Andrews (2014).
In particular their Figs 1 and 2. A few key points to keep in mind:

- The gas radial velocity is non-zero; in fact, there is an outward moving
   part, like for real viscous spreading. However, for this test case the
   gas itself is not evolved in time. Physically this is not self-consistent,
   since the gas moves, yet does not change Sigma_gas in time. But it is,
   after all, just a test case.

- Another assumption of this test case is that while the viscosity is 1e-3
   for the computation of the gas velocity, the turbulent mixing of the dust
   is set to zero. Here this is done by setting the Schmidt number Sc to a very
   large number. Also this may be physically problematic, but then again, we
   do not really know what causes the viscosity of the disk. And, again, it is
   just a test case.

- It is the outward v_gas and the zero d_mix that lead to a dust pile-up at
   a very narrow radial range around 100 au. This is indeed also what is
   seen in Fig 2 of the paper.
