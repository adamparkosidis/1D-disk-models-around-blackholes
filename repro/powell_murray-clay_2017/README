Here we try to reproduce the result from the paper Powell & Murray-Clay 2017 of
TW Hydra. They say that they can keep the large grains long enough in the disk
if they make the disk much more massive than normally assumed (and much more
massive than derived from CO measurements).

We model the same disk, with the same model assumptions for Sigma_gas(r) and
T(r). We focus on their 9 mm grains.

Conclusion: Yes, DISKLAB finds similar results.

Note that DISKLAB keeps some large grains in the very outer regions (>300 au).
This is because the 9 mm grains will have Stokes numbers >> 1 in these
regions, so they will simply become orbiting bodies. But this does not affect
the conclusions, because the surface density there is very low (<1e-6 g/cm^2).
