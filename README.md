# DISKLAB

## Installation and use

For notes on how to install and use `disklab`, please read the tutorial, which can be found in the `tutorial/` directory ([here](tutorial/disklab_tutorial.pdf)).

Typically you would install it by executing this in the top-level directory of this repository:

    pip install -e .

This installs a development version, i.e. if you modify the code, those changes will be reflected if you `import disklab`. To install a static version of the current code, leave out the `-e` option.

## Examples

All examples, including those from the [tutorial](tutorial/disklab_tutorial.pdf) can be found in the [snippets folder](snippets).
