By default the DISKLAB toolset works in CGS units. But you can simply
change that to SI by copying from this directory the natconst_SI.py
to disklab/natconst.py

You can undo that by simply copying natconst_CSG.py to disklab/natconst.py

You can also *locally* use SI units in some working directory, while
keeping the main DISKLAB package in CGS. This is done by copying the
natconst_SI.py into your local working directory.
